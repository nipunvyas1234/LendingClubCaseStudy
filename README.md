## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
- The project is about doing an exploratory data analysis on dataset containing loan details of borrowers. The file has been provided in the portal. The code expects the file to be present in same directory as the notebook and name of data file should be "loan.csv". We have performed various steps like data cleaning, data sanitization, data manipulation, outlier analysis, univariate analysis, segmented univariate analysis, bivariate analysis using pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib in python
- What is the background of your project?
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
Identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc
- What is the dataset that is being used?
loan.csv file provided 

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- When providing loans dti (debt to income ratio) is towards higher side than such loans should be rejected or be executed with caution
- High amount loan should not be give for following purpose “Small business, credit_card and debt_consolidation”. They generally are    defaulted
- House loans with high interest rates must be watched out for default
- Borrowers with high dti should be avoided
- Verification of income should be conducted using better processes and should be more strict
